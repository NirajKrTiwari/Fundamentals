Java LinkedList
----------------
The LinkedList class is almost identical to the ArrayList

Example:
// Import the LinkedList class
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    LinkedList<String> cars = new LinkedList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");
    System.out.println(cars);
  }
}

Q. How the ArrayList works
Ans: The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.

Q. How the LinkedList works
Ans: The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.
